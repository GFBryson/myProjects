	NEW_IDEA: maze runner
		use ai in neaural networks to make a predictive maze runner program
		which leans and predicts thebest ways to navagate the maze
			-future applications could be for mapping routes to 
			 destinations (google map style)
		say it looks at the last 10 moves te 'runner' made to analyse 
		and determin the probabuility of the correct direction to go at the 
		next junction
	
	Needed_Knowledge:
		2D image processing
		inner workings of Artificial Neaural Networks (ANN)
		how to use statistics to determin probabuilities
	
	Language considerations:
		while i dont know how the ANN wouks i am unsure of what language 
		to use, but it would be nice to learn a new one. Possibly C# or C++ or
		I could go back to java which i havent used for a while. 
		
		I feel like python would defitly be an easier way to get started 
		(as I've been using it recetly with strugBot) but im not sure if it 
		will give me the right level of controll needed for this project.

		It might come down to what it will take for the image processing 
		actually. 
		
		NOTE_TO_SELF: Talk to Bill about what he used when he 
		teaches the 2D image procesing course.
