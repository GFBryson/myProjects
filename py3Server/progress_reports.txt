I can get the server (slackServer.py) to receive GET requests and even write back information but 
only when i set the server ip to be 127.0.0.1

When i set it to any of the other ip's that my computer says it works off of it doesnt
even seem to receive a get request. 

Further it appears as though Slack wants an adress in the form of http rather than an ip address so
im going to have to look into how to hook up an address to my computer or hwo to get cloud space
	Amazon does cloud hosting. may need to look into that as eventually this cant run on my
	laptop as its not always connected to the internet
Slack also wants the server to be encrypted with SSL. So thats another thing to ass to the research list.

Goal for the day ---> get server working on ip other than 127.0.0.1:8888

So far the server seems to know when it receives a GET request but is having issues sending information 
out to the browser. Hopefully this will be fixed soon and i can work on how to get and store the POST
requests that slack makes

After looking at the API's for making a '/' command in Slack it appears as though ill need
a server so i can respond to POST requests that the app will make.

After doing some reaserch and getting help from a professor (Bill Bird) I have a better 
idea of how to do this.  

I have attempted to start making this server in Python as it seems to be the easiest to start with
