	So now comes the part of how to implement the storing of events data so that it will be save when 
	the bot turns off (weather for testing or if it crashes for some reason)
	My current thought is to implement a database in something like sql or sqlite

Feb 10th 2018 --------------------------

	Implemented n array or responses for the 'hello' prompt and set it so it would randomly choose one each time it 
	replies

	Strug now responds to queries about the current date and the current time

	Yay! So I have gotten the most simple of bots up and running :D so far it can detect when someone 'mentions' it (@StrugBot)
	and it can reply when someone says hello in a mention

16:03
	Got the environemnt working (forgot to use source in front of the activation command) and got it up on the git
	(although it seemed to need alot of packages)

15:25
	it was recommended that I use virtualenv to run my python in with pip
	i installed it and made a new environment in my git folder however it doesn't seem to want to let me run it
	so thats a new issue .... but not a trail breaking one. i can still continue down this path

12:45
	fixed issue with ip (forgot to call respond) moving on to working with post request. I may use Mozilla
	to test getting post requests before worrying about making it secure, although I do plan on asking about
	it as reading break starts tomorrow

10:48
	I can get the server (slackServer.py) to receive GET requests and even write back information but
	only when i set the server ip to be 127.0.0.1

	When i set it to any of the other ip's that my computer says it works off of it doesn't
	even seem to receive a get request.

	Further it appears as though Slack wants an address in the form of http rather than an ip address so
	I'm going to have to look into how to hook up an address to my computer or how to get cloud space
		Amazon does cloud hosting. may need to look into that as eventually this cant run on my
		laptop as its not always connected to the internet
	Slack also wants the server to be encrypted with SSL. So thats another thing to ass to the research list.





	Goal for the day ---> get server working on ip other than 127.0.0.1:8888
		GOAL ACHEIVED


Feb 2nd 2018 ---------------------------

	So far the server seems to know when it receives a GET request but is having issues sending information
	out to the browser. Hopefully this will be fixed soon and i can work on how to get and store the POST
	requests that slack makes


Feb 1st 2018 ---------------------------

	After looking at the API's for making a '/' command in Slack it appears as though ill need
	a server so i can respond to POST requests that the app will make.

	After doing some reaserch and getting help from a professor (Bill Bird) I have a better
	idea of how to do this.

	I have attempted to start making this server in Python as it seems to be the easiest to start with
