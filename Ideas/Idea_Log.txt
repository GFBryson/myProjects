 UPDATE: class_mate ideas were/are being integrated into the strugBot project (located in the py3Server folder)

 New Idea: Artificial neaural networks. Wouldnt it be cool to make something that can recognise hanwritten words? or make strugBot have more fluid and 'human' style interactions with users? 
	Machine learning and AI have always intrugued me. so many things could be possible. 
	I would need a project thats complicated enough to challange, but not so much that it is impossible.
	
	neaural networks work when one neauron fires and signals another one, so 
	that in the end the most 'signald' neauron is the end result. So it would 
	need to be given a task where it is trying to identify sonething, or learn 
	how to compleat a task. 
	
	what about a maze solver. a maze solver that dies every time it gets stuck 
	and has to restart. It would learn each time what worked and what didnt, and
	then could look too see if those learned assumptions could be applied to 
	other mazes.
	
	The runner would get expert at small mazes, and then use that learning to 
	make assumptions about the most optimal paths to use on the next maze. 
	
	mazes can't be random. not if they are created with any purpose. 
	Human nature is to create patterns even where we are trying not too, 
	because trying to not make a pattern in itself makes a pattern, even if we 
	cant see it. A computer could, couldn it?
	and even if a computer made it there isnt any true randomness to that either.
	the programming it followed wouldnt be random and even a call to a 'random' 
	integer/float/long is dependant on something non-random. 

	I will need to look into how to process an image... start in 2D then maybe
	build it up to a 3d cube like maze

Class_Mate:
  Ok new idea. Not that I dont think the full app is possible( it's perfectly possible).
  But to start out I'm going to make this a simple bot designed for slack that keeps track of assignments
  and alerts channels on due dates for upcoming projects.
  I still want to make the full app, but I want to try it on a (very) small scale first.

  Starting by looking into slack api's now :)

Class_Mate:
  there are many types of scheduler apps out there for students that are supposed to help them
  keep track of classes, assignments, and other due dates. As a Student I have tried a lot of them..
  and usually I find something about them lacking.

  Some make you delete your old classes before you input new ones, some dont give you proper
  reminders for assignments or due dates. Some are so rigid you cant out in a one time event
  such as a group meeting or an up coming study session. Many allow you to enter in a teachers
  name but no other information that would make contacting them easier.

  So here is my idea.
  These are the key elements of what I would want to make in a scheduler app.
    -allow you to schedule multiple semesters at once
    -have multiple calendars for anything they want
      -ex(work, school, volunteering etc..)
      -able to be turned on and off of the calendar display portion
        -turn on and off friend schedules
    -tabs for
      -calendar
      -assignments
      -exams
      -up-coming events
      -daily overview
      -index
    -sharable
      -calendar(s) can be shared with friends or groups.
      -You can choose to always have someone know your schedule or make it a limited time viewing.
      -its not just like a photo, as you make changes to the schedule your 'followers' would
      see the changes on their side
      -make it so you can compare your schedules with any selected friends who have shared it with you
    -index
      -holds contacts for friends and 'followers'
      -where you can input teacher information
    -teacher information
      -allows you to input teachers office number, phone number, email etc to make contacting
       them for help easier
      -you can assign office hours to them which you can use to look at when you could go see them
      based on that compared to your schedule
    -alerts
      -alerts are auto set to remind you 2 days before due date and then again 4 hours before hand
      -these can all be changed depending on class or for the individual assignment
