  Ok new idea. Not that I dont think the full app is possible( it's perfectly possible).
  But to start out I'm going to make this a simple bot designed for slack that keeps track of assignments
  and alerts channels on due dates for upcoming projects.
  I still want to make the full app, but I want to try it on a (very) small scale first.

  Starting by looking into slack api's now :)

  there are many types of scheduler apps out there for students that are supposed to help them
  keep track of classes, assignments, and other due dates. As a Student I have tried a lot of them..
  and usually I find something about them lacking.

  Some make you delete your old classes before you input new ones, some dont give you proper
  reminders for assignments or due dates. Some are so rigid you cant out in a one time event
  such as a group meeting or an up coming study session. Many allow you to enter in a teachers
  name but no other information that would make contacting them easier.

  So here is my idea.
  These are the key elements of what I would want to make in a scheduler app.
    -allow you to schedule multiple semesters at once
    -have multiple calendars for anything they want
      -ex(work, school, volunteering etc..)
      -able to be turned on and off of the calendar display portion
        -turn on and off friend schedules
    -tabs for
      -calendar
      -assignments
      -exams
      -up-coming events
      -daily overview
      -index
    -sharable
      -calendar(s) can be shared with friends or groups.
      -You can choose to always have someone know your schedule or make it a limited time viewing.
      -its not just like a photo, as you make changes to the schedule your 'followers' would
      see the changes on their side
      -make it so you can compare your schedules with any selected friends who have shared it with you
    -index
      -holds contacts for friends and 'followers'
      -where you can input teacher information
    -teacher information
      -allows you to input teachers office number, phone number, email etc to make contacting
       them for help easier
      -you can assign office hours to them which you can use to look at when you could go see them
      based on that compared to your schedule
    -alerts
      -alerts are auto set to remind you 2 days before due date and then again 4 hours before hand
      -these can all be changed depending on class or for the individual assignment
