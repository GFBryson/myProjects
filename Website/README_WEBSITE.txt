This file holds all the code i have set up which makes up my personal webpage
	gillianfbryson@gmail.com
which has been my personal challenge project

I have done small bits of HTML/CSS in the past, and wanted to put myself to the challenge
of creating this site compleatly from scratch wighout the use of webmaker tooks (asides form dreamweaver because seeing my changes as they happen is magic!)

Currently is is pretty simple but im hoping to soon expand it into javing some javascript anaimaitons and such.


To DO:
	About page needs to be started
	Projects page needs to be started
		Should show progress on projects and have links to repo's
		have images to show ideas and future plan ideas (balsamiq demos)
